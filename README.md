# Concurrency-Project-CLI-Concurrent-Downloader
Hi! This is a big project from the topic Concurrency from my Software Architect and DevSecOps Engineer road map. For the concurrency project, I'm creating a CLI (Command-line Interface) Concurrent Downloader to download data from such websites concurrently! Follow instructions of how_to_use.txt to use it. Below is high level design of my CLI Concurrent Downloader!
