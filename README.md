# Concurrency-Project-CLI-Concurrent-Downloader
Hi! This is a big project from the topic Concurrency from my Software Architect and DevSecOps engineer road map. For the concurrency project, I'm creating a CLI (Command-line Interface) Concurrent Downloader to download content from such websites concurrently! Check out instructions in how_to_use.txt! Check out my benchmark and analysis comparing downloading using threading, asyncio, and multiprocessing of 10 URLS and 100 URLS in my Road Map Repo: https://github.com/WillyPhan06/Software-Architect-and-DevSecOps-Engineer-Road-Map/tree/main/Concurrency/FinalProject
